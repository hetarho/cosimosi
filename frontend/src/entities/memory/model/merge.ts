// Refetch → render-store merge (spec 16 §동기화=병합). A GetUniverse refetch must NOT

// instance slots (coordinates derive from array position — constitution §3), and roll
// back locally-advanced timestamps/weights. Both merges are append-monotone (nothing is
// ever removed — constitution §2) and conflict-free by max(): MVP server changes are
// monotonic (weight grows, timestamps advance), so max(server, local) is exact.
// v1+ bidirectional reconsolidation (#23) makes weights non-monotonic — revisit then.
// Pure: no three/React/DOM (ESLint pure layer), unit-tested in merge.test.ts.

/**
 * Merge an incoming (server) star set into the local render set, keyed by memory id.
 * - Existing stars keep their OBJECT IDENTITY (slot `index`, seed, emergent position)
 *   unless the server's lastRecalledAt is ahead — then only that field advances (max).
 * - `relevance` (spec 26) is taken from the server UNCONDITIONALLY: it is a server-computed
 *   signal (cos vs the "요즘 토픽" centroid) that shifts between fetches as the centroid moves,
 *   and the client never advances it locally — so a max()/keep-local merge would freeze it at
 *   the first-load value. Forwarding it keeps decay-resistance current as 요즘 evolves.
 * - The reshaping state (`brightnessOffset`/`hueShift`/`formSeedDelta`/`version`, specs 23·27)
 *   is ALSO taken from the server unconditionally, for the same reason: it is server-authoritative
 *   (reconsolidation reshapes on recall, the nightly gist simplifies form — both server-side) and
 *   the client never advances it optimistically ("낙관 갱신 아님"). A keep-local merge would freeze
 *   the star's shape at its first-load version, so a recalled-reshaped or night-gisted star would
 *   never visibly change on an in-session refetch. Forwarding makes those re-shapes land.
 * - Local-only stars are kept: `temp-` optimistic stars (replaceStar owns their swap)
 *   and just-confirmed stars a stale response doesn't include yet.
 * - Server-only stars are appended at the end → next free instance slots.
 * Returns the SAME array reference when nothing changed (skips a re-render/rebuild).
